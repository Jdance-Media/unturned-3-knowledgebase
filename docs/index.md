# Overview

The Unturned 3 Knowledgebase is *unofficial* the home of documentation for all things unturned 3.

With information both written by contributors and pulled from official game documentation and modified for improved readability. The goal of this site is to be a one stop shop for all the more technical features of the game including modding, server hosting, and issue troubleshooting. It is maintained by khakers and indirectly pulls from Nelsons U3 docs.
