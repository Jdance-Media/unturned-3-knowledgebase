Many properties of the different engine types are shared between them, however, some are specific to each engine type, and are categorized as such below. Vehicle Data Vehicle Agnostic properties Battery Properties Driving Properties Fuel Health Explosion Turret Properties Damage Properties Bicycle Properties Misc. Plane Boat Train Vehicle Agnostic properties ID : The item ID is used to spawn the item into the game, and is represented as an unsigned 16 bit integer (a range of 0\u201365535). It is recommended not to use a value less than 2,000 as those are reserved for official content. It is also recommended to avoid any ID range being used by curated content, as those are often used by modded servers and custom Workshop maps. Vehicles ID ranges do not conflict with those of Items or Objects. Bypass_ID_Limit : Allows you to use an ID that is within the space reserved for vanilla content.
